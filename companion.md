# companion.md — Robot Team Orchestrator

**This file is the single source of truth for the robot_team project.** It knows
everything about the fleet and orchestrates a swarm of simpler **A32 agents**.
Read it first, every session. When something here is wrong or stale, fix *this
file* — it is the brain, not a logbook.

> Modeled on the `companion-arc` pattern from the ARC Prize project: one
> orchestrator that holds the whole picture and dispatches simpler, focused
> agents. There, the simpler agents were per-instance solvers. Here they are
> **A32 agents** — the ESP32 robots and the build-time subagents that own them.

## 1. What this project is

`robot_team` is **a team of ESP32 robots** that sense, reason, and act
*without* cloud LLMs or neural inference. Each robot is an **A32 agent**: a
deterministic device whose entire mind is a Toot-Toot Database (TTDB) markdown
file (see `RFCs/A32-RFC-0001-Architecture.md`). The robots form a
range-adaptive mesh (ESP-NOW in range, LoRa long-haul) and are coordinated by a
laptop **orchestrator** running the Locus reasoning loop and Dream Cycle.

- **The robots are dumb-but-deterministic.** Intelligence lives in their TTDB.
- **The companion (laptop) is smart.** It authors TTDB, reconciles beliefs,
  and dispatches commands. It is the only LLM in the system.
- **One protocol, the "toot."** Every message is a 250-byte toot frame, HMAC
  signed, dedup-keyed on `(src_node_id, toot_seq)`. See
  `toot_network_architecture.md`.

## 2. The fleet — the A32 agents it orchestrates

Each row is one A32 agent. The companion owns the contract; the agent owns its
firmware + TTDB. (Specs: `hardware_specs.md`; mesh roles:
`toot_network_architecture.md`.)

| Agent | Board | Role | Spine pos | Links | Power | Sketch | Status |
|-------|-------|------|-----------|-------|-------|--------|--------|
| **V4-A** | Heltec V4 | Bridge / head — laptop ↔ mesh gateway | head | USB-CDC + LoRa + ESP-NOW | mains, never sleeps | `firmware/v4a_bridge` | 🟨 scaffold (ESP-NOW + serial + TTDB-share; LoRa gated off) |
| **V4-B** | Heltec V4 | Relay / mid — store-and-forward long hops | mid | LoRa + ESP-NOW | solar + battery | `firmware/v4b_relay` | 🟨 scaffold (ttl/dedup forward; LoRa gated off) |
| **V4-C** | Heltec V4 | Edge / tail — remote cluster gateway, GNSS stamp | tail | LoRa + ESP-NOW | solar, off-grid | `firmware/v4c_edge` | 🟨 scaffold (cluster gateway; LoRa/GNSS gated off) |
| **K10-x** | UNIHIKER K10 | Percept node — camera/mic/accel, `@PERCEPT` capture, UI | leaf | ESP-NOW / WiFi | battery | `firmware/k10_percept` | 🟨 scaffold (ESP-NOW HELLO + TTDB-share over ESP-NOW & USB; full Agent32 loop wired to TTDB) |
| **orchestrator** | laptop | The companion itself — Locus loop, Dream Cycle, master TTDB | — | USB-CDC + WiFi | mains | `orchestrator/companion.py` | 🟨 scaffold (`pull` reassembles a node's TTDB) |

Legend: ⬜ not started · 🟨 scaffold (compiles/ports, not on-device verified) · ✅ on-device verified

**Build & deploy:** command-line **arduino-cli** (not PlatformIO — a project
decision overriding the A32-RFC default). Each node is a proper Arduino sketch;
shared code is in `firmware/libraries/`, supplied with `--libraries`. See
`CLAUDE.md` and `firmware/README.md`. Scripts: `scripts/{setup,build,deploy,upload-fs}.sh`.

## 3. The A32 agent contract

Every A32 agent the companion dispatches MUST satisfy this contract. This is what
makes the swarm composable — the companion can reason about any node uniformly.

1. **Boots from TTDB.** Mounts LittleFS, parses the `mmpdb` header, validates
   `db_id` + `umwelt`, seats the cursor. No TTDB → no behavior.
   (`A32-RFC-0002`, `A32-RFC-0003`.)
2. **Runs the sense → reason → act loop.** Quantize sensors to TTDB
   coordinates → nearest node → follow typed edges → act. No inference.
3. **Speaks toots.** Emits/accepts the 250-byte frame; HMAC-signs; dedups on
   `(src, seq)`; honors `ttl`. Transport per the range-adaptive ladder.
4. **Streams, never slurps.** TTDB is read via file-offset index; never loaded
   whole. Feeds the watchdog (`yield()` ~every 100 iters).
5. **Is auditable.** TTDB is human-readable markdown. Firmware is a generic
   interpreter; the TTDB gives it purpose.
6. **Has a native-test build.** Parser + loop logic compile and pass on the
   `native` PlatformIO env with mock sensors (`A32-RFC-0004 §6`).

## 4. How the companion orchestrates

The companion wears two hats. Both dispatch "A32 agents," at different times.

### 4a. Build-time — Claude Code subagents
When building/maintaining a node, the companion spawns a focused subagent that
owns exactly one row of the fleet table: its firmware (`src/`, `lib/`), its TTDB
(`data/<node>.md`), and its native tests. The companion hands it:
- the **A32 agent contract** (§3),
- the node's **role + hardware constraints** (§2 row, `hardware_specs.md`),
- the relevant **RFCs**.

The subagent returns when its node passes native tests and (where possible)
on-device serial assertions. The companion updates the fleet status column.

> Spawn one subagent per node only when the user asks for parallel/agentic
> builds. Otherwise the companion builds nodes itself, in dependency order.

### 4b. Run-time — physical robots
Once deployed, the same A32 agents run autonomously. The companion (laptop)
orchestrates them live:
- Injects **CMD** toots through V4-A (bridge) over USB-CDC.
- Collects **PERCEPT** / **BELIEF** toots back across the A→B→C spine.
- Runs the **Dream Cycle** to consolidate gossiped beliefs into the master TTDB.
- Re-authors node TTDBs and reflashes when behavior must change.

## 6. Current state & next action

- **State:** Specs and RFCs exist; no firmware, no TTDB files, no `PLAN.md`
  execution yet. Fleet is all ⬜.
- **Next action:** Begin Phase 0 in `PLAN.md` — scaffold the PlatformIO project
  and the A32/TTDB libraries so the first two K10s can exchange toots over
  ESP-NOW broadcast (the cheapest path to a live swarm).

Keep this section current. It is the first thing the next session reads.
