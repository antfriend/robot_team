    note: "2026-07-29: the K10 left this map (still on v1 firmware, off the band roster and off the current mesh) and the Cardputer joined it. Selecting a record here opens that node's INTEROCEPTION in the record pane, so the map is now navigable INTO each body, not just across the topology."

seed: unfused - own @LAT97 windows only, no SP2 embedding has included this node yet
evidence: its last link-percept window (master/cardputer_1.md @LAT97LON12) heard all
four peers over ESP-NOW at rssi_max -34 (T-Deck) / -35 (V4-B) / -40 (V4-A) / -40
(V4-C); the radii above are those through the SP1 calibration
RSSI(d) = -6.3 - 48.4*log10(d).
caveat: those radii are BENCH scale while the three static nodes above still carry
GARDEN-run coordinates (embedding_rev 4, 2026-07-13), so the drawn triangle is
INCONSISTENT on purpose rather than by accident - 3.7 + 5.0 cannot also be 41.8. The
fix is a fresh proximity -> positions -> fleetmap run with the whole fleet powered and
the bridge cabled, which needs hardware this session did not have. Believe the sigma,
not the dot.
